# W3Schools Website Testing Project

## 📝 Introduction
This project focuses on **testing the functionality and visibility** of the W3Schools website using **Cypress**. The goal was to validate that all elements are correctly displayed and functional as per the website's design and requirements. The project followed a systematic testing approach with detailed documentation and execution.

## 🔍 Project Type
**Automation Testing using Cypress**  
The testing included writing Cypress scripts for functionality and visibility checks.

## 📁 Directory Structure
- **Test Plan**: Document outlining the scope, approach, and strategy for testing.  
- **RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)**: Mapping of requirements to test scripts to ensure full coverage.  
- **Test Scenarios**: High-level scenarios based on user interactions.  
- **Test Scripts**: Cypress scripts written for functionality and visibility checks.  
- **Bug Report**: Detailed document of identified issues and their resolutions.  
- **Summary**: Overview of the testing performed on the W3Schools website.  
- **Mind Map**: Visual representation of the testing flow and approach.

## 🎯 Features Tested
1. **Navigation**  
   - Validation of header links, menus, and submenus.  
2. **Search Functionality**  
   - Checking the search bar's responsiveness and accuracy.  
3. **Page Visibility**  
   - Ensuring all elements are visible and interactable on different pages.  
4. **Responsiveness**  
   - Testing on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).  
5. **Form Validations**  
   - Checking input fields, buttons, and error messages.  
6. **Error Handling**  
   - Validation of broken links or non-functional elements.

## 🛠️ Design Decisions and Assumptions
- Focused primarily on **UI testing** and **visibility validation**.  
- Assumed cross-browser compatibility as a functional requirement.  
- Used Cypress for fast and reliable test execution.
